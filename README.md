# Pneumonia_Classification
Classifying MRI Lung Images

This project is using a popular kaggle dataset that contains patient MRI images of their lungs and the goal is to detect whether it is a healthy lung or it is an viral/bacterial infection(pneumonia).

This is written in PyTorch using Transfer learning based on Google's Vision Transformer (ViT).

It has great accuracy of 0.9645 and loss of 0.2113 when I trained it for 3 epochs but I accidentaly close it during its training (total of 5) :( Also, I am currently learning how to use experiement tracking in PyTorch so I will come back later to implement that part and finish the project.

For example:
